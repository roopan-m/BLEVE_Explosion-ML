# BLEVE_Explosion-ML
Machine Learning models tuned to predict blast wave propagation in a BLEVE explosion

Models used: **Simple Linear Regression, Gradient Boost Decision Tree, Neural Network, XGBoost (Varient of Decision Tree)**

*Report Included for detailed usage of each model and their effectiveness against tabular data 

**main.ipynb** is quite rough around the edges since all model implementations needed to be in the same file, so to execute all cells for file uploading, many functions are commented out
